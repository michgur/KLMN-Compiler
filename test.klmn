# (int, int) (a, b) = (1, 2) # a:int -> 1, b:int -> 2
# don't do anything too complicated with these (no generic tuples or anything)
#   a. not the intention, these are just here to replace structs
#   b. will create unclear syntax
#   c. will be more difficult to implement & less efficient overall
#
#
# official syntax:
# type id[ = value][, id[ = value]...] ;
# WHERE type can be: type name, array, or tuple (maybe generics in the future)
#       id can be:   name, multiple names surrounded with parentheses
#       value can be: expression, multiple expressions surrounded with parentheses
